# Hello, and Welcome!

My name is Vaughn, and this is my personal repository. 
I am a graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering
from Iowa State University. 

I enjoy working with embedded systems, using C programming
primarily. 

Currently, I'm working to strengthen skills and expand my
depth of knowledge about embedded systems and the C language.

I'd like to explore DSP and controls theory in the near future,
and embedded Rust later on.

I aim to work in the automotive/motorsport industry, and I am
excited about the future of powertrain technology, strategy,
safety, and sustainability.

A little late to the proper personal github party but here 
regardless :)
